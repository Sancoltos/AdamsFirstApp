## Setup Steps, Deviations and time taken

I followed the setup steps all the way through as best as I could. I only deviated from the setup
when the app failed to launch and required us to not install CLI globaly 


-first first setup step took a while at least 2 hours

-second was exploring the file structure which I took the suggested amount of time and looked at each file

-third step was to modify the code. I took longer than the 45 minutes for this because I wanted to have some fun 

-fourth step i played with for about 20 mins looking throught the dev tools and watching hot refresh work. I programmed a 
autokey to keep the sim on top of vscode so I didnt have to switch inbetween windows

-I already had a git repo setup so I linked it to my github and pushed took about 5 minutes
