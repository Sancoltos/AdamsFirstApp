## Setup Steps and deviations

I followed the setup steps all the way through as best as I could. I only deviated from the setup
when the app failed to launch and required us to not install CLI globaly 

first first setup step took a while at least 2 hours while the rest I took my time with and moved on when i felt I had finished the step
